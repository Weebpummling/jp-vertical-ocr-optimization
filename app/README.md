# Layer 3 — Transcription workstation

The human-primary core. Three panes: zoomable page (cell auto-centered) · structured entry
form (氏名, 兵科, 階級, 職名, 任官年月日, seniority, notes) · candidate/verification panel
(OCR + VLM + propagation + prior-year values).

Requirements that are not negotiable:

- **Keyboard-first and IME-aware** — a whole officer enterable without the mouse.
- **Controlled-vocabulary autocomplete** for branch/rank/post → normalized in one or two keystrokes.
- **Date normalizer** parses 明治/大正/昭和 to canonical dates; ambiguous parses are **flagged,
  not guessed**.
- **Difficult-character toolkit** — variant palette (kyūjitai↔shinjitai), radical/IDS lookup, and
  attach-the-cropped-glyph when a character cannot be typed, so reading is never blocked.
- **Furigana and per-character uncertainty capture**; one-click seal/damage flag → alt-scan flip
  or expert queue.
- **Suggestions look visually distinct from confirmed values.** The reader transcribes; the
  machine offers. That independence is the entire statistical basis for treating machine
  agreement as corroboration.
